# iExec Confidential Computing Scoring Algorithm

A production-ready decentralized application demonstrating confidential computing on the iExec network.

## Overview

• **Purpose**: Secure scoring algorithm that processes encrypted data within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
• **Functionality**: Accepts encrypted numerical inputs, performs computation in hardware-secured enclaves, returns unencrypted results
• **Core Use Case**: Input integer A → Apply scoring algorithm (A × 2) → Deliver results without exposing sensitive data
• **Technology Stack**: iExec decentralized cloud infrastructure + Intel SGX technology
